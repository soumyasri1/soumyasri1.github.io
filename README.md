-> This project is a Digital Alarm Clock that enables users to set multiple alarms.

-> The first part of the project features a digital clock that updates every second.

-> In the second part, users can set alarms that will be added to a list below and will play at the designated time.

-> Each new alarm comes with a delete button that can be used to disable and remove the alarm from the webpage.

-> The technology stack used for this project includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

-> The approach taken involves adding each alarm to an array, which is checked every second to see if it contains the current time.
       
       If the array contains the current time, the alarm sound will be played.
       Clicking on the "Stop Alarm" button will pause the audio, while clicking on the "Delete Alarm" button will remove the alarm from both the array and the list.
